### Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Retrieve channel metrics (views, subscribers, etc.) using the YouTube API.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Identify growth patterns.
    - Analyze video performance (likes, comments, shares).
3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
    - Test if certain video types lead to more subscribers.
    - Investigate correlation between watch time and views.
4. **Content Strategy Recommendations**:
    - Optimize video titles, descriptions, and thumbnails.
    - Experiment with different video formats.
    - Collaborate with other creators.
