### Business Understanding
As a YouTube content creator, I want to analyze my channel's performance and identify growth opportunities. This project aims to track key metrics, such as views, subscribers, and engagement, to optimize content strategy and maximize channel growth.

### Data Understanding
- **Data Sources**: Utilize YouTube Analytics data, including video views, watch time, subscriber count, and audience demographics.
- **Data Collection**: Extract data using YouTube API or export data from YouTube Studio.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform data for analysis.

### Visualizations and Results
- Create visualizations to showcase growth trends over time:
    - Line charts for views, watch time, and subscribers.
    - Heatmaps for peak posting times.
    - Geographic maps for audience distribution.
- Highlight significant milestones (e.g., hitting 1,000 subscribers).
- Include screenshots of YouTube Studio dashboards.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data extraction, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Document code and analysis.
- **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**: Data manipulation and visualization.
- **YouTube API**: Retrieve channel data programmatically.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install required Python packages (`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`).
3. Obtain YouTube API credentials.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to fetch data and generate visualizations.

### Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Retrieve channel metrics (views, subscribers, etc.) using the YouTube API.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Identify growth patterns.
    - Analyze video performance (likes, comments, shares).
3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
    - Test if certain video types lead to more subscribers.
    - Investigate correlation between watch time and views.
4. **Content Strategy Recommendations**:
    - Optimize video titles, descriptions, and thumbnails.
    - Experiment with different video formats.
    - Collaborate with other creators.

### Project Status
- Ongoing: Regularly update data and monitor growth.
- Future Enhancements: Sentiment analysis of comments, A/B testing for thumbnails, and SEO optimization.

### Credits
- YouTube API documentation.
- Inspiration from other data analysts' portfoliosÂ¹Â².
